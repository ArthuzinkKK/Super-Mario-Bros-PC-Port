# Super Mario Bros NES Game & Builder

Author: Andrew Kellogg

Super Mario Bros NES Game & Builder is a faithful simulation of the original Super Mario Bros. game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Whether you’re a fan of the classic game or a budding game designer, this project allows you to create your own custom levels with all the classic capabilities, without the limitations imposed by the NES hardware.

Custom Level Details: Set custom level names, time limits, pipe colors, and other options.

Password Protection: Share unchangeable designs with other players by password-protecting your games.
